# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrew Black

I'm a full-stack developer from `🌍 Szeged` with a focus on [`TypeScript`], [`C#`], and [`Go`]. I'm a very fast learner in most programming languages.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I learn the fastest by diving head first into the problem, and if that doesn't work, by researching it. While counter intuitive, this has helped me get started with the world of programming! Nowadays, I do research, but after I tried figuring out the solution by myself 😅

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I specialize in game development, modding, and in building websites.
Currently I run multiple organizations and projects in my spare time.

Building useful websites and tools for the community is my passion.
